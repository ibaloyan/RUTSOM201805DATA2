# Functions

* In this activity, you will write a function to compute the arithmetic mean (average) for a list of numbers.

## Instructions

* Write a function called `average` that accepts a list of numbers.

  * The function `average` should return the arithmetic [mean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_mean) (average) for a list of numbers.

* Write a function called `main` that will call the other function `average` with test data. For example: `average([1, 2, 3])`.

* Test the code in the terminal by running `python main.py`.
