# City Population

In this activity, we will add a circle for each country's World Cup information.

## Instructions

* Add your code to [logic.js](Unsolved/logic.js) to show the following:

  * A circle for each country in the data set.

  * A radius size by how many points the country has.

  * Countries with over 200 points have the color yellow.

  * Countries with over 100 points have the color blue.

  * Countries with over 90 points have the color green.

  * Remaining countries have the color red.

* Make sure that for each vector layer you include has a popup with the country's name and points.

## Hints

* The radius will need to be adjusted universally for a better visual.

* Refer to the [Leaflet docs for Path Options](http://leafletjs.com/reference-1.0.3.html#path-option) if stuck creating vector layers.
